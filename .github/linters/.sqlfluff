## This /.sqlfluff file can be used to configure the SQLFluff linter when
## used via the GitHub Super Linter. More parameters can be found at 
## https://github.com/github/super-linter/blob/main/TEMPLATES/.sqlfluff
##
## IMPORTANT NOTE: The GitHub Super Linter configuration file for SQLFluff
## supersedes any local configuration files you might have in within your
## codebase. For this reason it should only be used when you want the same
## configuration for your entire code base. If you need different configuration
## in different folders you must leave this config commented out, and instead
## manage all your config files within your code base rather than in the
## .github/linters folder
