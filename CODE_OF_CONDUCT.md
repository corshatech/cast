# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Introduction

This code of conduct applies to all spaces associated with the Corsha API Scanner Tool (the “Project”), including public and private mailing lists, issue trackers, wikis, blogs, Twitter, and any other communication channels our communities use.

We expect everyone who participates formally or informally, or claims any affiliation with the Project, in any Project-related activities to honor this code of conduct.

This code is not exhaustive or complete. It distills our common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and goals. We expect all contributors  to follow it in spirit as much as in the letter, so that it can enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.

## Guidelines

We invite anyone to participate in the Project. We prefer to use public methods of communication for project-related messages, unless discussing something sensitive. This applies to messages for help or project-related support.

We work together to resolve conflicts, assume good intentions, and do our best to act in an empathetic fashion. We may all experience some frustration from time to time, but we do not allow frustration to result in a personal attack.

Other people will use our work, and we in turn depend on the work of others. When we make something for the benefit of the Project, we are willing to explain to others how it works, so they can build on the work to make it even better. Any decision we make will affect users and colleagues, and we take those consequences seriously when making decisions.

Asking questions early avoids many problems later, so we encourage questions, although we may redirect them to the appropriate person within the Project. Those who receive a question should be responsive and helpful, within the context of our shared goal of improving the Project’s code.

Whether we are participating as professionals or volunteers, we value professionalism in all interactions, and take responsibility for our own speech. Be kind to others. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior are not acceptable.

Over time, hundreds or thousands of people will read what you write. Writing a short email means people can understand the conversation as efficiently as possible. Short emails should always strive to be empathetic, welcoming, friendly and patient. When a long explanation is necessary, consider adding a summary at the top of the message. Try to bring new ideas to a conversation so that each email adds something unique to the thread. Try to stay on topic, especially in discussions that are already fairly long.

Members of every project come and go. When somebody leaves or disengages from the Project they should tell people they are leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where they left off. In doing so, they should remain respectful of those who continue to participate in the project and should not misrepresent the project's goals or achievements. Likewise, Project members should respect any individual's choice to leave the project.

## Diversity Statement

The Project welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. We are committed to being a Project that everyone feels good about joining. Although we may not be able to satisfy everyone, we will always work to treat everyone well.

Though we welcome people fluent in all languages, the Project development takes place in English.

## Reporting Guidelines

While all participants should adhere to this code of conduct, we recognize that sometimes people may have a bad day, or be unaware of some of the code's guidelines. When that happens, you may reply to them and point out this code of conduct. Such messages may be in public or in private, whatever is most appropriate. However, regardless of whether the message is public or not, it should still adhere to the relevant parts of this code of conduct; in particular, it should not be abusive or disrespectful.  Always assume good faith. Should there be difficulties in dealing with the situation, you may report your compliance issues in confidence to legal@corsha.com.

If the violation is in documentation or code, for example inappropriate pronoun usage or word choice within official documentation, report these privately to the project in question at legal@corsha.com, and, if you have sufficient ability within the project, resolve or remove the concerning material, being mindful of the perspective of the person originally reporting the issue.
